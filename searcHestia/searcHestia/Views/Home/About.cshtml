<h2>Why stay in a vacation rental?</h2>

<p>
    Vacation rentals can offer more space, privacy, and flexibility compared to hotel rooms.
    Depending on the property, you’ll have access to amenities like hot tubs,
    gourmet kitchens, washer/dryers, free onsite parking, private pools, and so many more.

<p>
    Vacation rentals are available in a wide range of locations so you can choose where you want to stay,
    like the center of the city or a local neighborhood with great nightlife.
    Plus, if you’re traveling with your family or a large group,
    having multiple bedrooms and bathrooms means there’s enough space so everyone can stay together under one roof.
